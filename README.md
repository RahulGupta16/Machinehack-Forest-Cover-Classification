# Machinehack-Forest-Cover-Classification


![22 Forest Cover Classification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56091634/88070452-53360600-cb90-11ea-8099-8c5cd00952f6.jpg)


The dataset has been taken from UCI, but to keep the spirit of competition right, we have added some noise in the labels. In this hackathon, we challenge all Machinehackers to predict the forest cover types (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data).The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30-meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region to Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from the data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS.The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type (one-hot-encoded).This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.
